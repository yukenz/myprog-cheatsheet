libiconv is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have libiconv first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libiconv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find libiconv you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/72.1/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/72.1/include"

  build flag for mac brew

export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/72.1/lib" && export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/72.1/include"
